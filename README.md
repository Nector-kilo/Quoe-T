**Welcome to Quoe-T**

**Introduction:**<br/>
This is my little pet project to help generate quotes for new and existing T-Mobile customers. This application was written in Kotlin for the Android operating system,
following a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural design and utilizing the JetPack Compose framework.
All code is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence 3.0, so feel free to change the code however you like, just make sure 
you follow the GNU GPL guidelines.

**Disclaimer:**<br/>
This program can make mistakes! I am not responsible for any misquotes due to the usage of this application within a retail environment.

**Instructions:**<br/>
Select either Existing Customer or New Customer.

**New Customer:**
1) Choose the Rate Plan.
2) Input the number of lines (Maximum is 5).
3) Fill in the data for the new device(s). You will be notified of any errors.<br/>
**Note:** Not every field needs to have a value, just the Number of Lines, and either Cost or BYOD needs to be checked.
4) Select Save & Close.
5) Present the quote to the customer.

**Existing Customer:**
1) WIP!

**Found a bug?:**<br/>
If you find any bugs, please email me directly at:<br/>

**Bug Tracker:**
1) Since Existing Customer isn't yet implemented, if the user presses the Existing Customer button, nothing will happen.
