# Quoe-T

This is my little pet project to help generate quotes for new and existing T-Mobile customers. This application was written in Kotlin for the Android operating system,
following a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural design and utilizing the JetPack Compose framework.
All code is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence 3.0, so feel free to change the code however you like, just make sure 
you follow the GNU GPL guidelines.

## Mobile Installation
1) Make sure you have "Install apps from unknown sources" enabled on your Android device.
2) Download and run the [Quoe-T.apk](https://github.com/NicholasGeraci/Quoe-T/raw/refs/heads/master/Quoe-T.apk) file to install the app.

## Usage Instructions
Select either Existing Customer or New Customer.

### New Customer
1) Choose the Rate Plan.
2) Input the number of lines (Maximum is 5).
3) Fill in the data for the new device(s). You will be notified of any errors.<br/>
**Note:** Not every field needs to have a value, just the Number of Lines, and either Cost needs to be filled or BYOD needs to be checked.
4) Select Save & Close.
5) Bask in the beauty of the Quoe-T.

### Existing Customer
1) WIP!
